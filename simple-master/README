Simple is a responsive starter web site template. It is intended to be basic and bare-bone, with minimum styling and options included. Still, it has features clients usually would ask for: menu with drop-downs, slider, grid layout. See full list of features below.

Simple is mainly for web designers (beginner to intermediate level). But it is so simple (pun intended:) ), that any person with very little knowledge of HTML can modify and use it.

To build a website with Simple, download it and add your own content and pages. Or, if you want a different design, you can tweak the CSS. In either case, you will have a device-agnostic website that works and looks great on smart phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. This tutorial will get you started and help you build a fully-functional site.

Simple is compatible with FireFox, Google Chrome, Opera, Opera Mini, Safari, IE9, 10. It is also compatible with IE8, but they will see the mobile layout. IE 6 and IE7 Must Die!
